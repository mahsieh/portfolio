                    <p>
                        This was my 1st project I worked during my HTML/CSS program. 
                        It helped me to learn how to apply Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to a webpage. The first iteration of the project used inline stylesheets, but it was converted to an external stylesheet stored in a subdirectory/folder.
